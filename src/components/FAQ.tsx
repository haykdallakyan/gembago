      question: "How does GembaGo AI improve Gemba walks?",
      answer: "GembaGo AI uses artificial intelligence to automate documentation, identify patterns in observations, suggest solutions based on best practices, and track action items through completion. This reduces the time spent on administrative tasks and improves the quality of insights gained during walks."
    },
    {
      question: "Can multiple team members collaborate on a single Gemba walk?",
